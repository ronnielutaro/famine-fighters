### Overview

The Famine Fighters platform is designed to facilitate food donations from individuals and businesses to local food banks, families and shelters in Karamoja Region. It aims to reduce food waste and combat famine by streamlining the process of donating and distributing food. This platform was originally created by the **Famine Fighters team**, a team of 15 girls together with myself as their Technical Lead. It leveraged the skills learned by the girls during the 10 days coding camp for the second phase of the **African Girls can Code Initiative** (AGCCI) in Moroto, Karamoja sub-region, between the 27th May - 7th June 2024, where I supported the implementation of this initiative as a Consultant and Instructor, training over 75 girls between ages 17-25 Computer Science Fundamentals. This is the platform a team of 15 that I mentored closely worked on. It is now open source and also being maintained by Ronnie Lutalo (myself) on behalf of the girls at the moment, this could change in the future however. Feel free to share ideas or open issues about the same on this repository and I'll be happy to follow through. In case you believe this project could be big as well, you're welcome to support or taking it to the next level, feel free to reach out to me via email: ronnielutaro@gmail.com
