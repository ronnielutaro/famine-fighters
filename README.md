### Overview

The Famine Fighters platform is designed to facilitate food donations from individuals and businesses to local food banks, families and shelters in Karamoja Region. It aims to reduce food waste and combat famine by streamlining the process of donating and distributing food. This platform was originally created by the **Famine Fighters team**, a team of 15 girls together with myself as their Technical Mentor. It leveraged the skills learned by the girls during the 10 days coding camp for the second phase of the [**African Girls can Code Initiative**](https://africa.unwomen.org/en/where-we-are/eastern-and-southern-africa/liaison-office-to-au-and-uneca/african-girls-can-code-initiative-agcci) (AGCCI) in Moroto, Karamoja sub-region, between the 27th May - 7th June 2024, aimed at closing the digital gender divide. I supported the implementation of this initiative as a Consultant and Instructor where I also trained over 75 girls between ages 17-25 Computer Science Fundamentals. All of these girls were using a computer for the very first time in the beginning. This platform was developed by a team of 15 girls that I mentored closely through a number of iterations before arriving to the final product currently in production. The platform is now open source and also being maintained by Ronnie Lutalo (myself) on behalf of the girls at the moment, this could change in the future however. Feel free to share your ideas or open issues about the same on this repository and I'll be happy to follow through. In case you also believe this project could become bigger as well, you're welcome to support or help take it to the next level, feel free to reach out to me via email: ronnielutaro@gmail.com
